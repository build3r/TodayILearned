Essay: http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html

Schlep = tedious, unpleasant task.

Schlep blindness = The unconscious mind not seeing valuable ideas that involve painful schleps/tedious tasks.

- schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty much what business consists of.
- Never shrink from schlep task if it in on the path to something great.
- If you pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges involved.
- Most valuable **antidote** to schlep blindness is probably **ignorance**
    - People not knowing how difficult the task is while starting might actually solve it.
- To find good problems inverse the thought process
    - Ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?"
