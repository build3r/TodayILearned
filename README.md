## Interesting TidBits
- Python List Comphrehension
A list comprehension looks like this:  
`new_list = [f(o) for o in a_list if o>0]`  
This will return every element of `a_list`  that is greater than 0, after passing it to the function f.

- You can use the [ADB accessibility](https://alexzh.com/adb-commands-accessibility/) to change the denity of Physical Device or Emulator to test you app UI on small screen devices
    ```
    adb shell wm density //see current density
    adb shell wm density 580 //set a different density
    adb shell wm density reset //reset denity to default
    ```
