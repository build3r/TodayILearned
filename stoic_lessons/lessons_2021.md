### Lessons From Stoics
Trying to inculcate stoic principles in life using "Daily Stoic" - By Ryan Holiday as a guide.
1. Jan 01: The greatest task you have in life is to differentiate between things you can control and things which are out of your control.
     >“Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood”
2. Jan 02: Education is freedom. We learn or read to be freer, fearless and to achieve state of peace. Education has a purpose that is to set a person free.
3. Jan 03: Learn how to say **No**, especially to time consuming emotion: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. The more say no to thing that don't matter, the more you can say to thing that do.
4. Jan 04: 3 main things of Stoic Philosophy
   1. Perception: control it, do not assume too much
   2. Action: direct it towards common good
   3. Will: to accept things which come you way which you cannot control
5. Jan 05: Always have an end in mind. Without which you won't know is astray from the path or if you have achieved what you set out for.
6. Jan 06: "Who are you?" is very loaded question in non superficial sense. Take time to ask this to yourself and come up with a clear answer. Because a person who doesn't know it will not know their purpose in life.
7. Jan 07:  The mind has 7 clear functions
   1. Choice: to always to the right thing
   2. Refusal: to refuse temptations and basal desires.
   3. Yearning: to be better 
   4. Repulsion: of bad habits, negativity, bad influences, lies etc
   5. Preparation: to tackle any obstacle that may arise
   6. Purpose: the guiding principle of life
   7. Assent: to understand and accept what is out of ones control.
8. Jan 08: Small addictions which we perceive as harmless can drive our lives ex coffee, checking mail etc. Addiction take away our freedom from abstaining them an cloud our clarity.
9. Jan 09: The things which you control (opinion, choices desire, aversion) are by nature free and unobstructed. While the others are weal, can be hindered and not yours. You may not control the situation, but you can control what you think about it.
10. Jan 10: To achieve steadiness, stability and tranquility you have to filter the outside world with the straightener of your judgement, you can't achieve them by running away from the world.
11. Jan 11: Serenity and stability are results of your reasoned choice and judgement, not the environment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to your tranquility then you will never be successful.
12. Jan 12: The path to happiness is giving up all the things outside of your control. Everyday remind yourself
    1.  Morning: What is and out of your control
    2.  Noon: The only thing you truly posses is ability to make choice.
    3.  Afternoon: Aside from choices you make, fate is not entirely up-to you.
    4.  Evening: again how much you control and where your choices begin.
    5.  Night: sleep is form of surrender.
13. Jan 13: There is only 1 thing in your control "**Your Mind**". 
14. Jan 14: The world creates vices for your attention and money like (food, social media, porn etc). But instead of being a a puppet to these vices pay careful attention and strive not to be a pawn.
     > “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” - Viktor Frankl
15. Jan 15: Tranquility and peace is found by identifying your own path and sticking to it and making small adjustments here and there, not by changing the path every 3 sec due to distracting information.
16. Jan 16: Some we get stuck in old ways and do thing based on rote memory. So ask yourself **"Is this really the best way to do?**
17. Jan 17: You don't exert yourself because you will have a ready-made excuse "It doesn't matter, I wasn't even trying". This may not have serious consequences in your youth but as you get older they affect the quality of your life and your ability to deal with world around. You have the best teacher from all over the world and time, Utilize them. You just have to start the work.
18. Jan 18: Look at the world like poet looks at it, find beauty even in mundane things. Because it provides you clarity and joy instead if you see the world as a dark place.
19. Jan 19: If you are having a hard time or an easy time the only thing in your control is your choice. So focus on what is your control.
20. Jan 20: There may be times where you question your beliefs, thats natural. Wh at matters is you evaluate it and reignite and restart.
21. Jan 21: Have a morning ritual and ask hard questions to yourself and write them down for yourself not for anyone else. Ex: 
    1.  What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion?
    2.  What for tranquility?
    3.  What am I? A mere body, an engineer, or reputation? None of these things.
    4.  What, then? A rational being.
    5.  What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions.
    6.  How did I steer away from serenity?
    7.  What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?
    8.  What did I fail to do in all these things?
22. Jan 22: People do bad things because they don't reflect upon what they did and only care about what to do. But our future plans descend from the past. The stoic believed in journaling your thoughts and actions as way to reflect upon them. 
23. Jan 23: Money only marginally changes things, it doesn't solve all the problems which people with no money believe it solves. External things (money) can't fix internal issues.
24. Jan 24: Just don't learn at surface level push for a deeper understanding.
25. Jan 25: If you keep your desires for what you actually enjoy then you will be more free and happy than struggling to achieve things just show off.
26. Jan 26: Have mantra in life which you can use in time you are going astray or taken up by your emotion. It could be like Marcus' “I have the power within me to keep that out. I can see the truth.”
27. Jan 27: Train yourself in 3 distinct areas of your life
    1.  Desires and Aversion: Don't just rely on the signal of your body, see what is good and avoid the bad.
    2.  Impulse to act/Motivation: Ask yourself are you doing it for the right reason?
    3.  Judgement: use your reason to see things clearly for what they are.
28. Jan 28: Have wise men in your life to follow and see what they do and what they don't. Use their experience to guide your decisions.
29. Jan 29: Just focus on the task in front of you, do it as if its the last thing you do.
30. Jan 30: Be content with not knowing things. You don't need to know everything just to seem smart, "I don't know" is acceptable.
31. Jan 31: Use philosophy to recharge yourself to do the right things when you are going adrift.

56. Feb 25: No matter what heights you achieve propelled by anger, obsession or hate. It will be akin to building a sand castle on a beach, sooner or later it will get washed away. So try to enjoy the brief time you have on Earth.
