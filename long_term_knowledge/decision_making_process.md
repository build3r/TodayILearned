### Decisions should be the result of rational and deliberate reasoning.

The intuition based decision which rely on our long term knowledge does not always leed to optimal solution and it blinds you from second-order effects.

Max Bazerman in Predictable Suprises wites:
### Decision Making process
1. Clear definition of teh decision to be made
2. Explicit statement of objectives
3. Explicit criteria for assessing the goodness(net cost of benefit) of alternative courses of actions
4. Potential courses of action and their consequences.

This allows the decision maker to asses tradeoffs based on potetial costs and benefits of different courses of action.

Layout the decision in a tree fashion (decision tree analysis)

System 2 thinking can be broken down into 
1. define the problem; 
2. identify the criteria; 
3. weigh the criteria; 
4. generate alternatives; 
5. rate each alternative on each criterion; 
6. compute the optimal decision.

Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa suggest 8 steps in their book Smart Choices:
1. Work on the right problem.
2. Identify all criteria.
3. Create imaginative alternatives.
4. Understand the consequences.
5. Grapple with your tradeoffs.
6. Clarify your uncertainties.
7. Think hard about your risk tolerance.
8. Consider linked decisions.

The drawbacks are:
1. The assumption that teh decision maker is completely informed about all possible outcomes and options.
2. The DM does not fall prey to biases.
